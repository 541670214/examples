# Macaron Examples

Simple examples for Macaron + X.

For simplicity, every example puts all files (each file represents a module) in one directory, and use models directly inside routers, but these are **NOT** the best practice. Please put each module in its own directory and separate layers correctly in your real world web apps.

Also, please ignore the content of `Makefile`, it is only useful for this particular purpose. You do **NOT** have to have a `Makefile` for Macaron apps.
